# PULSE + STARTRAM Project Website

This website documents our undergraduate research projects:  
- **PULSE** (Powering and Unifying Long-range Sensor Ecosystems)  
- **STARTRAM** (Sensor Technology for Alaska Rural communities Targeting Remote Atmospheric Monitoring)

Both projects focus on remote sensing, non-cellular data transmission, and STEM education in rural Alaska.

Built with Jeckyll and maintained by students at UAF with support from URSA, ACEP, and the T3 Program.

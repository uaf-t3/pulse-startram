# Welcome

This site documents two student-led undergraduate research projects at the University of Alaska Fairbanks:

- **PULSE** — *Powering and Unifying Long-range Sensor Ecosystems*  
- **STARTRAM** — *Sensor Technology for Alaska Rural communities Targeting Remote Atmospheric Monitoring*

Both projects are supported by the **URSA** program and developed in collaboration with the **Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP)** and the **Teaching Through Technology (T3)** program.

### What We’re Building

PULSE and STARTRAM are focused on creating rugged, deployable weather and environmental monitoring systems that work in Alaska’s most remote locations. These systems are designed to be:

- **Low cost and open source**  
- **Non-cellular**, using mesh radios like the *Heltec v3 Board* (LoRa)  
- **Solar powered and winter-ready**  
- **Simple enough for high school students to deploy with guidance**

We’ve worked directly with students, teachers, and field researchers to figure out what works and what doesn’t, when it comes to remote data collection in cold, low-connectivity environments.

### Why It Matters

This work matters because it brings together **research and education** in a practical, impactful way.  
Students don’t just learn about sensors, they build real systems that solve real problems. These projects:

- Equip rural communities with the tools to monitor their own environments  
- Support STEM learning through hands-on workshops and field testing  
- Contribute to citizen science by generating usable environmental data  
- Help educators and researchers evaluate and deploy resilient sensing systems
